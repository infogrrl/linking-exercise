Program and outputs from the IPUMS data engineer linking exercise v1.4

# Recreating this analysis
To begin, download the Jupyter notebook (data-engineer_linking-ipums-v1-4.ipynb) from this repo and download the source files from https://github.com/mnpopcenter/data-engineer-exercise.

If you don't already have Jupyter notebooks installed, the easiest way to get set up is to install Anaconda for Python3: https://www.anaconda.com/download.

Once everything is installed, open an Anaconda prompt.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the source files and the Jupyter notebook.  Run the command: `jupyter notebook`

The prompt window should give you a URL with a log in token the first time you are running the notebook.  Copy the link to the running notebook (something like http://localhost:8888/?token=abc123de) into a browser window if it doesn't launch automatically (depends on the version you're running.)  

Hopefully you now have a window in your browser that shows the directory where your jupyter notebook is saved in a helpful interface.  Click on the file name of the notebook in the interface to launch it.  This should open it in a new browser tab.  

You can now run the cells to recreate the process I used to complete the exercise and regenerate the output!  All further documentation needed to recreate the process is within the notebook itself.
